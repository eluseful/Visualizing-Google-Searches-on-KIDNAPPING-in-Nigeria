# Visualizing-Google-Searches-on-KIDNAPPING-in-Nigeria

Google searches on the Key-word **KIDNAPPING**

This project draws inspiration from the work of [Lisa Homung](https://github.com/Lisa-Ho/small-data-projects/commits?author=Lisa-Ho) on **Sourdough**
using the [Pytrend library](https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/). Before this period, I played around with [Pytrends](https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/) and became fascinated with the tool.

The search keyword is a trending topic in Nigeria due to a series of insurgencies and banditry attacks perpetrated in several regions of the Country. So I decided to play around with this data and replicate the work of **Lisa** with some slight tweaks.
